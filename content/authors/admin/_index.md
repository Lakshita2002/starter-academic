Bonjour à tous! Myself Lakshita Mohanty, a second year undergraduate student here at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. My interests include buying endless number of books and not reading them timely. I like to draw and cook occasionally.

I am currently working on relaxing and not stressing out about "not stressing out about academics" My goal for this summer is to finish the pile of books that I've created.
